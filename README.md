This repository demonstrates a common SQL error: using `LIMIT` without `ORDER BY`. The `bug.sql` file contains the erroneous query, while `bugSolution.sql` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises because without an `ORDER BY` clause, the database's selection of rows is arbitrary for `LIMIT` making the results non-deterministic. Adding `ORDER BY` ensures consistent, reproducible results.
